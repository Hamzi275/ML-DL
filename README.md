## ðŸŒŸ My ML/DL Journey

Working on these projects has been a cornerstone of my journey as an **AI Engineer**.  
They allowed me to:
- Develop expertise in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling noisy datasets**  
- Master a wide range of **ML algorithms** and build **hybrid ensembles** for optimal performance  
- Gain deep knowledge of **CNN architectures** (LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, ZFNet)  
- Apply **evaluation techniques** including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and training curves  
- Build confidence in **tackling complex and large-scale ML/DL tasks**

## ðŸ”¥ Reflection

Although this repository is being uploaded a bit later, it represents the **culmination of everything I learned and practiced in ML and DL**.  
Each project here reflects not just an implementation, but a step in my growth â€” from understanding fundamentals to confidently applying advanced techniques.  

Through these projects, I have **mastered almost all key aspects of ML/DL**, while continuing to learn and explore cutting-edge advancements.
